bugs to fix:
- mouse hover animation
- tab focus animation

must finalize:
- finalize triple input support: tab, arrow keys, mouse/touch (that's a big one)
- finalize back button support: escape key


good to add:
- user preferences
- cookies
- full mouse/touch support: add a visual, clickable back button
- enhanced experience with viewport aspect ratios far from 16:9 and mobile devices



nice to add:
- multiple background videos
- additional user preference: choice between randomized or user-defined background video


===========================================

decided not to add:
- tab navigation: trap focus
